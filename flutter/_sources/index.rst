Flutter
=========

Flutter is one of the world’s most popular frameworks for building beautiful, fast, and modern applications. If you want to create apps for **Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS,** and **Linux** — all from a **single codebase** — Flutter is the perfect choice.

What Is Flutter?
------------------

Flutter is an **open-source UI framework** created by **Google.**
It allows developers to build **high-performance, natively compiled applications** using a single programming language called **Dart.**

Unlike other frameworks that rely on native UI components, Flutter **draws everything on the screen itself** using its own rendering engine.
This is why Flutter apps look clean, smooth, and consistent across every device.

Why Flutter Is Popular
------------------------

	**•	One codebase for all platforms**

   Write once → Run on mobile, web, and desktop.

	**•	Super fast performance**

   Flutter apps compile to native machine code.

	**•	Beautiful UI**

   Flutter provides thousands of widgets to design smooth, modern, animated interfaces.

	**•	Hot Reload**

   Change your code → see updates instantly without losing app state.

	**•	Backed by Google**

   Strong community, regular updates, and long-term support.
