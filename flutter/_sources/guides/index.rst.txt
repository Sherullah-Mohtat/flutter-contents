Guides
======

This **Guides** section is a collection of task-oriented how-tos for getting Flutter up and running on every platform you care about. It walks you through both **installation** and **configuration**, step by step, with real command-line examples and screenshots.

For each platform — **Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux** — you will find:

   •	How to **install** the required tools (SDKs, IDE plugins, emulators/simulators, device drivers).

   •	How to **configure** Flutter for that platform, including:

      •	updating pubspec.yaml and shared Flutter settings

      •	platform-specific commands (for example flutter config, flutter doctor, Xcode and Android Studio setup)

      •	creating a **small sample app** and running it on an emulator, simulator, or real device to verify everything works

Start with the shared Flutter configuration, then open the guide for your target platform and follow the examples line-by-line to get a working development environment.
