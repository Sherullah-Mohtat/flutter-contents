Tutorials
=========

This section is the best place to begin if you’re new to Flutter or want a practical, project-based learning experience. Each tutorial walks you step-by-step through real examples, showing **how Flutter works in action**, not just in theory.

Inside this section you will find:

**Quickstart**

A fast introduction for beginners.

You’ll learn how to:

   •	install Flutter,

   •	create your first project,

   •	run the app on a device or emulator, and

   •	understand the basic folder structure.

The Quickstart gives you the foundation you need so you can begin building immediately.

**First Project**

A guided, project-based tutorial where you build a small but complete Flutter app from scratch.

Each step is explained with:

	•	clear code examples,

	•	screenshots,

	•	reasoning behind widget choices, and

	•	best practices for structuring your UI and logic.

This page focuses on learning through building—every concept is introduced through actual hands-on implementation.

Use these tutorials as a starting point. Once you complete them, you’ll have the confidence to explore more advanced widgets, routing setups, layouts, animations, and app architecture throughout the rest of the documentation.
